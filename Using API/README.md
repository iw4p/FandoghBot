fandogh has official api doc [Fandogh API](https://github.com/fandoghpaas/fandogh-cli/blob/master/api-docs/api-contract.yaml
) but unfortunately It does not have exec on its api, so I can't no longer work on it.

The way to install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`  

Running bot 
`python3 bot.py TOKENBOT`
